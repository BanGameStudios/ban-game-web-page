Un UHC Más is an event PvP inspired in the famous UHC game mode but with great additions, where 10 teams of 4 people had to fight to see who is the best and take home the prize of 100 BITS.

Some of the great additions were: the implementation of mods, new structures, new animals, things from the 1.17 in the 1.16, events during the match and more.

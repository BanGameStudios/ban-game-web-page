Un UHC Más 2 is the second edition of a PvP event inspired in the famous UHC game mode but with great additions, where 12 teams of 4 people had to fight to see who is the best and take home the prize of 100 BITS.

Some of the great additions were: the implementation of mods, new structures, new animals, new death system, mini-events during the game and more.
